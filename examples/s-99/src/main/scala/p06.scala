  // traverses the list twice: once to reverse it, and once to check equality.
  // Technically, we only need to check the first half of the list for equality
  // with the first half of the reversed list.  The code to do that more
  // efficiently than this implementation is much more complicated, so we'll
  // leave things with this clear and concise implementation.
